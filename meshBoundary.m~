%---------------------------------meshBoundary---------------------------------%
% This funciton meshes the boundaries of the domain. It takes as an input a
% NURBS curve ( in the form of its control points and knot vector) and a
% user defined number of elements to mesh the edge with. It outputs a series
% of control nets and nodal points corresponding to one "layer" of
% triangular elements along the boundary. It also outputs a list of nodes
% that fall on the outer boundary jsut created (bNode) and a connectivity
% array of these nodes(bEdge). These are for passing to a third party mesh
% generator to mesh the interior volume that's away from the edges.


% Inputs:
% P = control points of the nurbs curve
% KV = knot vector of the nurbs curve.

% Output
% B: a 1 x 2*nel cell of control nets
