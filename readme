P and KV are cell arrays containing the control points and the knot vectors for the inputted NURBS curve

P, each cell will contain a nX3 array of control points (the control net of the global geometry -- or each independent matlab cell)

KV, each cell will contain an 1xm array of knots (the knots for the global geometry -- or each independent matlab cell)

n = number of control points
m = number of knots

h is a 1 x numberOFCurves(cells) array containing the number of straight segments to break each curve into

options is a struct containing flags for doing things like lifting the surface, or further subdividing the curve.

lifting the curve is creating a layer of curvilinear triangles at the interior of the boundary, in order to feed the remaining polygon to the external mesh generator.
